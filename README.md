# Sample Code

This is a example of the code that we write in PSB for common tasks. In this example, there is a feature for connecting the tariff. One screen is just a landing page with information and two screens that collect information from the user.

## what do we use
- Swift
- MVVM
- Responder Chain - to easily redirect user actions within the application without unnecessary complications. [How we use it](https://habr.com/ru/company/psb/blog/597759/) 
- In our project, we reuse ready-made UI components that are synchronized with the design system. Our screens are assembled like Lego. DSKit is closed source, so there will be no examples here.
